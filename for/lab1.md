**Problem: Calculate Discounted Prices**<br>
You are given an array of product prices. Write a TypeScript program or function that uses the forEach() loop to calculate and display the discounted price for each product. Apply a discount of 9% to each product.
```ts
let productPrices: number[] = [25.99, 14.49, 32.75, 19.95, 45.30];

// Your code here

// Output: Discounted Prices: 23.39, 13.04, 29.48, 17.96, 40.77
```
Your task is to use the forEach() loop to iterate through the array of product prices, apply a 10% discount to each price, and display the discounted prices as shown in the comment.
