**Problem: Filter and Sum**<br>
You are given an array of numbers. Write a TypeScript program or function that uses the forEach() loop to filter out even numbers, calculate the sum of the remaining odd numbers, and display the result.
```ts
let numbers: number[] = [10, 25, 8, 17, 30, 21, 12, 19];

// Your code here

// Output: Sum of odd numbers: 82
```
Your task is to use the forEach() loop to iterate through the array of numbers, filter out even numbers, calculate the sum of the remaining odd numbers, and display the result as shown in the comment.
